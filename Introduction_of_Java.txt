
-----------------History of Java-----------------

Java Orginally invented from Green Team at sun microsystems in 1995.
Now sun microsystems is subsidiary of oracle corporation.

Currently, Java is used in internet programming, mobile devices, games, e-business solutions etc.

"James Gosling" developed  the Java Programming language .

Java firstly , it was called "GreenTalk" from "JAMES GOSLING with extension .gt
later it was called "Oak".

The word Oak is a tree  name , later renamed to "JAVA".
Orginally java is a island of indonesia where first coffee was produced.

Now will have a look on Java version history

JDK 1.0 	-- 1996
JDK 1.1 	-- 1997
J2SE 1.2	-- 1998
J2SE 1.3	-- 2000
J2SE 1.4	-- 2002
J2SE 5.0	-- 2004
Java SE 6	-- 2006
Java SE 7	-- 2011
Java SE 8	-- 2014

-------Features of Java--------
==========================
1-Simple
2-Object-Oriented
3-Platform independent
4-Secured
5-Robust
6-Architecture neutral
7-Portable
8-Dynamic
9-Interpreted
10-High Performance
11-Multithreaded
12-Distributed
==========================
Simple : java language is simple because it follows c++ based syntax

Object -Oriented: Like in c++ it support OOP's Concept .java is pure OOP.

Platform Independent: platform is the hardware or software enivronment, java code can be run on multiple platforms eg:Windows,Linux,Mac etc 
Java code is complied by the compiler and converted into bytecode. This bytecode is a platform-independant code because it can be run on multiple platforms."Write once & run anywhere"

Secured: Java code run inside the virtual machine , so its provide a secure way to access a internet applications .

Robust: The word Robust means Strong .
In  java there is lack of pointeres so its avoid security problem.

Architecture Neutral : java build .class extension it can run on any machine without considering  architecture 

Portable: java is portable which can run on any machine write once run anywhere concept.

Dynamic: It loads the class files at runtime ,anything happens at runtime is conidered as Dynamic.

Interpreted: java is compiled language ,but rather than compile straight to executable machine code,it compilesto an intermediate binary form called JVM byte code.
The byte code is then compiled and or interpreted to run the program.

High Performance: java is interpreted language ,so it ll never be fast as c orc++, but java enables high performance with use of just in time compiler.

Multithread:A thread is like a seperate program,java deals with many tasks once defining multiple threads.
advantage of multithreading is that it doesn't occupy memory for each thread.

Distributed:java supports distributed applications can access files by calling the methods from any machine on the internet.
